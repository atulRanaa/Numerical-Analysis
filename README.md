# Numerical-Analysis
Finding the roots of the equations (actually is approximate root thats why we) using Numerical Analysis Algorithms. 
1 . Bisection / Interval Halving Method (in Programmer it is famous by name Binary Search).
2 . Regula-Falsi Method (teacher said we are assuming that the function is straight as we are finding the root in very small
interval that why Falsi term intoduced in method name. :) )
