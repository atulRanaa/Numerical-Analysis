# Numerical-Analysis
#### Finding the roots of the equations (actually is approximate root thats why we) using Numerical Analysis Algorithms.
  1. Bisection / Interval Halving Method (in Programmer it is famous by name Binary Search).
  2. Regula-Falsi Method (teacher said we are assuming that the function is straight as we are finding the root in very small interval that why Falsi term intoduced in method name. :) )
#### Numerical Integration: (newton forword interpretation application, equal size interval division)
  1. Trapezoidal Rule
  2. Simpson's 1/3rd Rule
  3. Simpson's 3/8th Rule
  4. Weddle's Rule
#### The system of Linear Equations:(iterative method having limited capabilities)
  1. LU Decomposition Method( Cholesky's Decomposition
  2. Gauss-Seidel Method
  3. Jacobi's Method
#### Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations:(tangent dependent formula)
  1. Euler's Method
  2. Modified Euler's Method
  3. Runga-Kutta Method( of 4th Code)
